# 🖼️ Image Deblurring Notebook

This project demonstrates image deblurring using Python. The Jupyter Notebook `Image_deblur_pynb.ipynb` walks through the steps required to load, process, and deblur an image using either classical techniques or deep learning models.

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── Image_deblur_pynb.ipynb      # Optional folder for input images
└── README.md

## 🚀 Getting Started



### 1. Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install the required libraries:

### 2. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Image_deblur_pynb.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your browser. Follow the instructions within the cells to run each step.

## 🧪 Sample Input

Place your blurred images in a directory named `sample_input_images/` or update the path inside the notebook to point to your image location.

## 📦 Output

Deblurred images will be displayed in the notebook or optionally saved to disk depending on the code implementation.

## 🛠️ Features

- Classical image deblurring using filters (Wiener, Gaussian, etc.)
- Deep learning-based restoration (if implemented)
- Comparison of before-and-after images
